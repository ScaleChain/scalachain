/** Stores block header, block, and transactions in the block.
  *
  * Blocks are stored in two cases.
  *
  * 1. During IBD(Initial block download) process
  *   * We use headers-first approach, so we download all headers from other peers first.
  *     These headers are kept in the key/value database first.
  *   * After all headers are downloaded, we download block data from other peers.
  *     When we store blocks, we store them on the record storage, which writes records on blkNNNNN.dat file.
  *   * After the block data is stored, we update the block info on the key/value database
  *     to point to the record locator on the record storage.
  *
  * 2. After IBD process, we receive a block per (about) 10 minutes
  *    In this case, both header and block data comes together.
  *    We put both block and block header at once.
  *
  *
  * Upon receival of blocks, we maintain the following indexes.
  * keys and values are stored on the key/value database, whereas records are stored on the record storage.
  *
  * 1. (key) block hash -> (value) (block info) record locator -> (record) block data
  * 2. (key) transaction hash -> (value) record locator -> (record) a transaction in the block data.
  * 3. (key) file number -> (value) block file info
  * 4. (key) static -> (value) best block hash
  * 5. (key) static -> (value) last block file number
  *
  * How block headers and blocks are stored :
  *
  * 1. Only blockheader is stored -> A block data is stored. (OK)
  * 2. A block is stored with block header at once. (OK)
  * 3. A block is stored twice. => The second block data is ignored. A warning message is logged.
  * 4. A blockheader is stored twice. => The second header data is ignored. A warning message is logged.
  *
  * @param directoryPath The path where database files are located.
