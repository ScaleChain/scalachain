Under construction
==================
ScaleChain source code is under construction. Big changes are to come to integrate distributed neural network.
The latest release does not include the integration of distributed neural network yet.

Current project status
======================
Unit tests passed.

ScaleChain Commercial License for OEMs, ISVs, and VARs
ScaleChain provides its ScaleChain Server and Client Libraries under a dual license model designed to meet the development and distribution needs of both commercial distributors (such as OEMs, ISVs, and VARs) and open source projects.

For OEMs, ISVs, VARs and Other Distributors of Commercial Applications:
OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers), ISVs (Independent Software Vendors), VARs (Value Added Resellers) and other distributors that combine and distribute commercially licensed software with ScaleChain software and do not wish to distribute the source code for the commercially licensed software under version 3 of the GNU General Public License (the "GPL") must enter into a commercial license agreement with ScaleChain.

For Open Source Projects and Other Developers of Open Source Applications:
For developers of Free Open Source Software ("FOSS") applications under the GPL that want to combine and distribute those FOSS applications with ScaleChain software, ScaleChain open source software licensed under the GPL is the best option.

For developers and distributors of open source software under a FOSS license other than the GPL, ScaleChain makes its GPL-licensed ScaleChain Client Libraries available under a FOSS Exception that enables use of the ScaleChain Client Libraries under certain conditions without causing the entire derivative work to be subject to the GPL.
